# Assignment A4: Urbanism
- Raymond Ma [mar47@mcmaster.ca]

## Rationale

- This pathfinder first converts the Mesh into a Graphical Representation with Nodes. This extension was created to build a profile to be able to work with graphical algorithms such as Dijkstra's Algorithm used to find the shortest path.

### Explanations

- By extending the library, I am able to call method from this subproject in the island generator file. This is useful as I will need to utilize graphical algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm in the island generator, and as pathfinder is a dependency of the generator, this can be easily done. 
- The central city in the star network is shown as a golden vertex to better show the user which is the city which is the star network.
